# HoodApp
## Background
This project began as an API demo to show I could spin up a basic useless "get the weather" app using OpenWeatherMap.org's API. As I moved along I veered off from the basic "Select a city" functionality and into building functionality to accept wilderness locations based on latitude/longitude settings. Then I realized there could be an actual use for this demo if it focused on Mt. Hood, and serving the information needs of those who climb it. 
## Challenges
I'm still never to the basic web technologies, so my progress is slow. The overriding purpose is still to serve as a demo project. We'll see how it comes out. 
## Options
- Single point of reference for scattered information on past, current, and forecast weather; snow conditions, including avalanche danger; reports submitted by climbers and skiers; and other practical information for climbers.
- Alternatively, it could develop into a virtual Hood climb for armchair travelers, using my extensive photo library and mapping software.
