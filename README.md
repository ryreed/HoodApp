# HoodApp
## Background
This project began as an API demo to show I could spin up a basic useless "get the weather" app using OpenWeatherMap.org's API. As I moved along I veered off from the basic "Select a city" functionality and into building functionality to accept wilderness locations based on latitude/longitude settings. Then I realized there could be an actual use for this demo if it focused on Mt. Hood, my local climbing destination, and serving the information needs of local mountaineers.  
## Challenges
CSS: still exploring CSS-based stylings such as parallax text, image animation, etc. 
JavaScript: API GETs are straightforward, but need to explore creating graphical presentations from JSON data.
## Options
- Single point of reference for scattered information on past, current, and forecast weather; snow conditions, including avalanche danger; reports submitted by climbers and skiers; and other practical information for climbers.
- Alternatively, it could develop into a virtual Hood climb for armchair travelers, using my extensive photo library and mapping software.
